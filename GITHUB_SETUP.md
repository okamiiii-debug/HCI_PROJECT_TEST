# GitHub Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to put this project on your GitHub:

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your local machine
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Steps to Push to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to github.com and log in
   - Click the "+" icon in the upper right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "real-study-wellness")
   - Choose public or private
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we'll push our existing files)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Initialize Git in your local project (if not already done)**
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Add all files to Git**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Student Wellness Application"
   ```

5. **Add the remote repository URL**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/real-study-wellness.git
   ```
   (Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username and 'real-study-wellness' with your repository name)

6. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```
   or if you're using main as the default branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

7. **Verify in GitHub**
   - Refresh your GitHub repository page to see your files

## Dependencies

Create a requirements.txt file in your GitHub repository with:
```
django>=5.0.0
```

## Additional Notes

- If pushing from Replit, you may need to set up your Git credentials
- Consider creating a branch strategy for future development
- You might want to add CI/CD workflows later using GitHub Actions
